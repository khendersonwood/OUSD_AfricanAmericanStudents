# African American Students in the Oakland Unified School District - Enrollment, Absenteeism and

This is data driven story reporting about African American students in the Oakland Unified School District, enrollment trends and absenteeism rates. This analysis is in response to Oakland Unified School District School Board's decision in February 2022 to shutdown seven schools, merge two and eliminate middle school grades in two more. The schools affected are schools with a student population that are predominately Black and Brown students.

  1. How does OUSD’s enrollment trends of African American students compare to the enrollment trends across California and the United States?

---
 First, I compared enrollment rates for [OUSD](https://dashboards.ousd.org/views/Enrollment/Historic?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowShareOptions=true&%3Adisplay_count=no&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Arender=false#7), [California and the United States](https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/36/school-enrollment-race/table#fmt=448&loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335,1&tf=110,124,108,95,88,84,79,73,67,64&ch=7,11,70,85,10,72,9,73&sortColumnId=0&sortType=asc).

### California Public School Enrollment for African American Students from 2011-12 to the 2020-21 
 
| 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |

### OUSD Public School Enrollment for African American Students from  2011-12 to the 2020-21 

| 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  14,743 |  14,173 |  13,775 |  13,434 |  13,077 |  12,836 |  12,643 |  12,319 |  11,717 |  11,173 |
  
OUSD, California and the United States all saw a decline in enrollment of African American students. I decided to calculate the percent change from the 2011-2012 school year to the 2020-21 school year to better understand how they compared to one another.
  
  ### United States (7,638,630 - 7,917,019)/7,917,019 = -0.03516336136 x 100 = -3.51633613611
     About a 3.5% decrease in African American student enrollment across the United States
  
 ### California (324,496-416,098)/416,098 = -0.22014525424 x 100 = -22.0145254243
     About a 22.01% Decrease in African American student enrollment in California

 ### OUSD (11,173-14,743)/14,743 = -0.24214881638 X 100 = 24.2148816387
    About a 24% decrease in in African American student enrollment in OUSD
  
  This data shows that there is a disparity in the loss of African American students, not only in California, but particulary in OUSD. I wanted to then look at OUSD's overall enrollment to see what that looked like.

  2. Is OUSD's overall enrollment falling as well?

 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  49,449 |  50,061 |  50,665 |  51,725 |  51,641 |  52,472 |  53,166 |  53,391 |  53,145 |  52,167 |
  
Despite OUSD's overall enrollment rising, their African American student population continues to fall.

Next, I wanted to look at Chronic Absenteeism amongst African American students. This data was collected from the Black Student Thriving Report that was given out at a local school board meeting on April 27, 2022 at La Escuealita Elementary School.

  3. How does OUSD’s African American student absenteeism rates compare to those across California?

[OUSD Data on absenteeism](https://data.oaklandca.gov/Equity-Indicators/Chronic-Absenteeism/5d4q-57a4/data) & [CA Data on absenteeism ](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQCensus/AttChrAbsRate.aspx?cds=00&agglevel=State&year=2020-21&initrow=Eth&ro=y)

![ChronicAbsenteeism](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99926470/167146193-8f816150-14bc-461f-9410-fbae535ae9f2.jpg)

  ** Please note that California does not have data from the 2019-2020 school year due to COVID and their 2020-21 data on absenteeism is not availble yet.
  
 OUSD consistently has higher rates of absenteeism for African American students in comparison to other African American students across the state. Since the 2011-12 school year, OUSD has experienced a 29.4% increase in abseentism, while the state of California has seen a 6.7% increase.
  
I then wanted to see how rates of absenteeism for African American students in OUSD compared to other races and ethncities in OUSD.

  3.Is absenteeism rising for all races in CA? Who is hit the hardest?  

  --- 
I used [CA Department of Education Data](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQCensus/AttChrAbsRate.aspx?cds=00&agglevel=State&year=2020-21&initrow=Eth&ro=y) to answer this question.  
  
To compare levels of absenteeism in California amongst races and ethnicities, I combined the data from the California Department Education from the 2017-2020  to one spreadsheet. Once I combined data from the 2017-2018 school year through the 2019-2020 school yea, I plotted the rates of overall chornic absenteeism by race and ethnicity on a line graph.
