# African American Students in the Oakland Unified School District - Enrollment, Absenteeism and Parker K-8

This is data driven story about African American students in the Oakland Unified School District, enrollment trends and absenteeism rates. This analysis is in response to Oakland Unified School District School Board's decision in February 2022 to shutdown seven schools, merge two and eliminate middle school grades in two more. A majority of schools affected have a student population that is predominately Black and Brown.

Since the announcement of school closures, the community of Oakland has rallied together to show their opposition to this decision. The community is calling school closures racist and inequitable, particularly for their Black students.

  1. How does OUSD’s enrollment trends of African American students compare to the enrollment trends across California and the United States?

---
 First, I compared enrollment rates for [OUSD](https://dashboards.ousd.org/views/Enrollment/Historic?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowShareOptions=true&%3Adisplay_count=no&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Arender=false#7), [California and the United States](https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/36/school-enrollment-race/table#fmt=448&loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335,1&tf=110,124,108,95,88,84,79,73,67,64&ch=7,11,70,85,10,72,9,73&sortColumnId=0&sortType=asc).

### California Public School Enrollment for African American Students from 2011-12 to the 2020-21 
 
| 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

### OUSD Public School Enrollment for African American Students from  2011-12 to the 2020-21 

| 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  14,743 |  14,173 |  13,775 |  13,434 |  13,077 |  12,836 |  12,643 |  12,319 |  11,717 |  11,173 |
  
OUSD, California and the United States all saw a decline in enrollment of African American students. I decided to calculate the percent change from the 2011-2012 school year to the 2020-21 school year to better understand how they compared to one another.
  
  ### United States (7,638,630 - 7,917,019)/7,917,019 = -0.03516336136 x 100 = -3.51633613611
     About a 3.5% decrease in African American student enrollment across the United States
  
 ### California (324,496-416,098)/416,098 = -0.22014525424 x 100 = -22.0145254243
     About a 22.01% Decrease in African American student enrollment in California

 ### OUSD (11,173-14,743)/14,743 = -0.24214881638 X 100 = 24.2148816387
    About a 24% decrease in in African American student enrollment in OUSD
  
  This data shows that there is a disparity in the loss of African American students, not only in California, but particularly in OUSD. I wanted to then look at OUSD's overall enrollment to see what that looked like.

  2. Is OUSD's overall enrollment falling as well?

 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 | 2015-16 | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  49,449 |  50,061 |  50,665 |  51,725 |  51,641 |  52,472 |  53,166 |  53,391 |  53,145 |  52,167 |

  ### OUSD overall enrollment (52167-49449)/49449= 0.05496572225 x 100 = 5.49657222593 
  About a 5.5% increase in enrollment in the OUSD school district from 2011-2020
  
Despite OUSD's overall enrollment rising, their African American student population continues to fall.

Next, I wanted to look at Chronic Absenteeism amongst African American students. This data was collected from the Black Student Thriving Report that was given out at a local school board meeting on April 27, 2022 at La Escuealita Elementary School.

  3. How does OUSD’s African American student absenteeism rates compare to those across California?
  
--- 
[OUSD Data on absenteeism](https://data.oaklandca.gov/Equity-Indicators/Chronic-Absenteeism/5d4q-57a4/data) & [CA Data on absenteeism ](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQCensus/AttChrAbsRate.aspx?cds=00&agglevel=State&year=2020-21&initrow=Eth&ro=y)

![ChronicAbsenteeism_OUSD_CA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99926470/167165879-6a184588-7f60-4bde-b16a-ecea6e439cfb.jpg)

[Link to Chronic Absenteeism Data Visualization ](https://infogram.com/copy-parker-data-1hxr4zxlowz3o6y)

  ** Please note that California does not have data from the 2019-2020 school year due to COVID and their 2020-21 data on absenteeism is not available yet.
  
 OUSD consistently has higher rates of absenteeism for African American students in comparison to other African American students across the state. Since the 2011-12 school year, OUSD has experienced a 29.4% increase in absenteeism, while the state of California has seen a 6.7% increase.
  
I then wanted to see how rates of absenteeism for African American students in OUSD compared to other races and ethnicities in OUSD.
    
  ---
<p align="center"> 
  4.Is absenteeism rising for all races in CA? Who is hit the hardest?  

  --- 
I used [CA Department of Education Data](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQCensus/AttChrAbsRate.aspx?cds=00&agglevel=State&year=2020-21&initrow=Eth&ro=y) to answer this question.  
  
To compare levels of absenteeism in California amongst races and ethnicities, I combined the data from the California Department of Education from the 2017-2020  to one spreadsheet. Once I combined data from the 2017-2018 school year through the 2019-2020 school yea, I plotted the rates of overall chronic absenteeism by race and ethnicity on a line graph. 

 ### Historic Rates of Overall  Chronic Absenteeism Rates in California by Race and Ethnicity

[Link to Chronic Absenteeism by Race Visualization](https://infogram.com/ousd-student-data-1h7k230pd30gg2x?live)
  
On average students who were White, Asian, Filipino or two or more races  had minimal increases, or even a slight decrease, in chronic absenteeism. In contrast, students who were Black, Hispanic, Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native and Pacific Islander have seen an increase in absenteeism.

<p align="center"> 
 5.  Which races/ethncities saw the most stark difference in chronic absenteeism?

  --- 
  
I  calculated the percent change from the 2017-2018 school year to the 2019-2020 school year to see if groups had an increase or decrease in absenteeism. Further, I wanted to see if particular groups had changed that were more stark or drastic than others.

![PercentChanges](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99926470/167150401-bdf5aaf9-be61-4eed-b3f7-862e69ab1019.jpg)
  
I then pasted the  % change into a separate sheet so I could sort them from highest to lowest.  
  
| Race                             | % Change |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| African American                 |    6.70% |
| American Indian or Alaska Native |    5.90% |
| Pacific Islander                 |    5.00% |
| Hispanic or Latino               |    5.00% |
| White                            |    0.30% |
| Two or More Races                |    0.30% |
| Asian                            |    0.10% |
| Filipino                         |   -1.00% |
  
I found that African American students had the highest increase in absenteeism since the 2017-2018 school year, followed by American Indian or Alaska Native students, and Hispanic or Latino students. 
  
Lastly, I wanted to take a deeper look at one of the schools that is set to close this school year, Parker K-8 and to look at their enrollment, particularly for African American students. To do this, I looked at OUSD enrollment again.

 6.  What does Parker's African American student enrollment look like over the years?

  ---

 The data  shows that Parker's African American enrollment has been falling. To get a better understanding of how Parker's demographics have changed over time I created an animated piechart to display Parker's demographics over the years.

# Data Story  
    
What started as a one-day teachers strike against school closures turned into a “Day of Action” on Friday, April  as the community joined educators on a march from the Lake Merritt Amphitheater to Oakland City Hall, on foot, bikes, rollerblades and in strollers.
Students held picket signs high and chanted: “This is what democracy looks like! This is what community looks like!”

Many parents brought their children, using the strike as a teaching lesson in activism, social justice and the right to protest.
“We want him to understand what’s going on and why he’s not in school today,” said Jessica Hallett, parent of a 5-year-old who goes to Piedmont Avenue Elementary School. 

The Oakland Education Association agreed to hold a single-day strike in response to the school board’s decision in February to close seven schools in the next two years, merge two others and eliminate middle school grades in two more. 

Under the closure plan, Parker and Community Day School will close at the end of this school year, and La Escuelita will shrink from a K-8 school to only an elementary school. Rise Community Elementary and New Highland Academy, which currently share a campus in East Oakland, will merge.
At the end of the 2022-23 school year, Brookfield Elementary, Carl B. Munck Elementary, Grass Valley Elementary, Horace Mann Elementary, and Korematsu Discovery Academy will close, and Hillcrest K-8 will lose middle school grades.  

The school board has been widely criticized not only by the community but by the Oakland City Council and Alameda Board of Education for the swiftness of its decision, which gives parents, students and teachers little time to process the closures. 
Since the announcement of school closures, Oakland has rallied together to show their opposition to this decision. The community is calling school closures racist and inequitable, particularly for their Black students. 

The Day of Action began at 6:30 a.m. when students, teachers, staff and community members picketed at individual schools before meeting at the Lake Merritt Amphitheater for a “Save Our Schools” block party. Bay Area Classics played along with the beats of drums and the long blows of wind instruments. Several community organizations were present including: Black Student Reparations, Oakland Rising, and SLAP — Schools and Labor Against Privatization — showing solidarity with staff and students affected by school closures and advocating for safe and racially just schools. 

Teachers said their students are devastated by the decision. And many teachers are looking for new jobs. 
“We’ve gone through so many emotional changes,” said Gail Wooley, a Parker K-8 teacher. “First, it’s like how? Why ? And then you just get into a depression that you can’t really tell yourself you’re in because you have to keep moving.” 

OUSD enrollment has been slightly rising over the years, about 5.5% from the 2011-2020 school year. In contrast, the African American student population has been dwindling. Since 2011, the Black population in OUSD has decreased by almost a quarter. Many view school closures as another event that will continue to push Black students out of OUSD, as many of the schools listed to close are made up of predominantly Black and brown students.

These worries may be validated by the rates of chronic absenteeism for African American students. OUSD, California and the United States are all experiencing a rise in chronic absenteeism for African American students. The rates amongst students at OUSD are consistently higher than the state or national average. African American students and American Indian or Alaska Native students are experiencing the highest levels of chronic absenteeism. 

Community members expressed concern that school closures would increase travel time for students and make them more vulnerable to predators and gun violence. Advocacy groups urged the crowd to vote for new school board members. And  students and parents spoke about what school closures would look like for them. 

“I’m standing up for every student,” said Isaac Murillo, an eighth grader at La Escuelita, which will lose its middle school grades. Isaac said he was a shy kid who had a hard time expressing his opinion. 

“So now I want to represent those kids that are so shy, and I want to teach them that a shy kid can also be a powerful kid,” he said. 

The community of Oakland is calling for more protests. And those fighting the plan got a boost from the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which filed a complaint on April 11 with the California Justice Department, calling the closure plan “racially discriminatory” because it  disproportionately affects Black students. The ACLU has asked the attorney general to investigate, alleging the plan “violates Black students’ fundamental right to equal educational opportunity under the California Constitution and discriminates based on race.” 
The organization wants the plan halted and the district ordered to conduct an equity analysis to guide any future closure decisions.
