This is data driven story reporting about African American students in the Oakland Unified School District, enrollment trends and absenteeism rates.

  1. How does OUSDâ€™s enrollment trends of African American students compare to the enrollment trends across the United States?

 First, I compared enrollment rates for both [OUSD](https://dashboards.ousd.org/views/Enrollment/Historic?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowShareOptions=true&%3Adisplay_count=no&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Arender=false#7) and all of the [United States](https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/36/school-enrollment-race/table#fmt=448&loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335,1&tf=110,124,108,95,88,84,79,73,67,64&ch=7,11,70,85,10,72,9,73&sortColumnId=0&sortType=asc).
  
  I then calculated the percent change from the 2011-12 school year to the 2020-21 school year for each.
